# BadLogic.
Learn AI the unintelligent way by solving logic problems with PyTorch.

## General Overview

### Project Goals
  * Part_A: Simple Regression Model  
  * Part_B: Bindary Classifier
  * Part_C: 'AND' gate		     
  * Part_D: Programmable AND/OR Gate
  * Part_E: Fully Programmmable Gate
  * Part_F: Recursive Logic Gate     

### Project Packages
  * regression - Use ratios of neighbor Fibonacci numbers to generate increasingly
  accurate approximations of ϕ. Train a network to produce a regression line
  that approximates ϕ.
  * titanic_mistakes - Simple classifier that examines the likelihood of surviving the titanic's maiden voyage. https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
  * last_names - Use a simple RNN to predict the language of origin of a given last name.
